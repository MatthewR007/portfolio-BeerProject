                                    Beer style is a term used to differentiate and categorize beers by various factors, including appearance, flavour, ingredients, production method, history, or origin. There is no universally agreed list of beer styles, as different countries and organisations have different sets of criteria.

                                    <p>Aeration: The action of introducing air or oxygen to the wort (unfermented beer) at various stages of the brewing process. Proper aeration before primary fermentation is vital to yeast health and vigorous fermentation. Aeration after fermentation is complete can result in beer off-flavors, including cardboard or paper aromas due to oxidation.</p>
                                    <p>Alcohol: A synonym for ethyl alcohol or ethanol, the colorless primary alcohol constituent of beer. Alcohol ranges for beer vary from less than 3.2% to greater than 14% ABV. However, the majority of craft beer styles average around 5.9% ABV.</p>
                                    <p>Alcohol by Volume (ABV): A measurement of the alcohol content of a solution in terms of the percentage volume of alcohol per volume of beer. This measurement is always higher than Alcohol by Weight. To calculate the approximate volumetric alcohol content, subtract the final gravity from the original gravity and divide by 0.0075. For example: 1.050 – 1.012 = 0.038/0.0075 = 5% ABV.</p>
                                    <p>Alcohol by Weight (ABW): A measurement of the alcohol content of a solution in terms of the percentage weight of alcohol per volume of beer. For example: 3.2 percent alcohol by weight equals 3.2 grams of alcohol per 100 centiliters of beer. This measure is always lower than Alcohol by Volume. To calculate the approximate alcohol content by weight, subtract the final gravity from the original gravity and divide by 0.0095. For example: 1.050 – 1.012 = 0.038/0.0095 = 4% ABW.</p>
                                    <p>Alcoholic: A person with a disabling disorder characterized by compulsive uncontrolled consumption of alcoholic beverages.</p>
                                    <p>Ale: Ales are beers fermented with top fermenting yeast. Ales typically are fermented at warmer temperatures than lagers, and are often served warmer. The term ale is sometimes incorrectly associated with alcoholic strength.</p>
                                    <p>Astringency: A characteristic of beer taste mostly caused by tannins, oxidized (phenols), and various aldehydes (in stale beer). Astringency can cause the mouth to pucker and is often perceived as dryness.</p>
                                    <p>Attenuation: The reduction in wort specific gravity caused by the yeast consuming wort sugars and converting them into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas through fermentation.</p>
                                    <p>Autolysis: A process in which excess yeast cells feed on each other producing a rubbery or vegetal aroma.</p>
                                    <p>B</p>
                                    <p>Barley: A cereal grain derived from the annual grass Hordeum vulgare. Barley is used as a base malt in the production of beer and certain distilled spirits, as well as a food supply for humans and animals.</p>
                                    <p>Bitterness: In beer, the bitterness is caused by the tannins and iso-humulones of hops. Bitterness of hops is perceived in the taste. The amount of bitterness in a beer is one of the defining characteristics of a beer style.</p>
                                    <p>Blending: The mixing together of different batches of beer to create a final product.</p>
                                    <p>Body: The consistency, thickness and mouth-filling property of a beer. The sensation of palate fullness in the mouth ranges from thin- to full-bodied.</p>
                                    <p>Bung: A sealing stopper, usually a cylindroconical shaped piece of wood or plastic, fitted into the mouth of a cask or older style kegs such as Hoff-Stevens or Golden Gate.</p>
                                    <p>Bung Hole: The round hole in the side of a cask or older style keg, through which the vessel is filled with beer and then sealed with a bung.</p>
                                    <p>C</p>
                                    <p>Carbon Dioxide (CO2): The gaseous by-product of yeast. Carbon dioxide is what gives beer its carbonation (bubbles).</p>
                                    <p>Cask: A barrel-shaped container for holding beer. Originally made of iron-hooped wooden staves, now most widely available in stainless steel and aluminum.</p>
                                    <p>Cellaring: Storing or aging beer at a controlled temperature to allow maturing.</p>
                                    <p>Color: The hue or shade of a beer, primarily derived from grains, sometimes derived from fruit or other ingredients in beer. Beer styles made with caramelized, toasted or roasted malts or grains will exhibit increasingly darker colors. The color of a beer may often, but not always, allow the consumer to anticipate how a beer might taste. It’s important to note that beer color does not equate to alcohol level, mouthfeel or calories in beer.</p>
                                    <p>E</p>
                                    <p>Esters: Volatile flavor compounds that form through the interaction of organic acids with alcohols during fermentation and contribute to the fruity aroma and flavor of beer. Esters are very common in ales.</p>
                                    <p>F</p>
                                    <p>Fermentation: The chemical conversion of fermentable sugars into approximately equal parts of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas, through the action of yeast. The two basic methods of fermentation in brewing are top fermentation, which produces ales, and bottom fermentation, which produces lagers.</p>
                                    <p>G</p>
                                    <p>Germination: Growth of a barley grain as it produces a rootlet and acrospire.</p>
                                    <p>Grain: The grains (Barley, wheat, rice, corn, oats, rye, etc.) are much the same as those that are used to make many breakfast cereals The barley and wheat must undergo a malting process before they can be used to make beer.</p>
                                    <p>H</p>
                                    <p>Hops: A perennial climbing bine, also known by the Latin botanical name Humulus lupulus. The female plant yields flowers of soft-leaved pine-like cones (strobile) measuring about an inch in length. Only the female ripened flower is used for flavoring beer. Because hops reproduce through cuttings, the male plants are not cultivated and are even rooted out to prevent them from fertilizing the female plants, as the cones would become weighed-down with seeds. There are presently over one hundred varieties of hops cultivated around the world. Apart from contributing bitterness, hops impart aroma and flavor, and inhibit the growth of bacteria in wort and beer.</p>
                                    <p>K</p>
                                    <p>Keg: A cylindrical container, usually constructed of steel or sometimes aluminum, commonly used to store, transport and serve beer under pressure. In the U.S.</p>
                                    <p>L</p>
                                    <p>Lager: Lagers are any beer that is fermented with bottom-fermenting yeast at colder temperatures. Lagers are most often associated with crisp, clean flavors and are traditionally fermented and served at colder temperatures than ales.</p>
                                    <p>M</p>
                                    <p>Malt: Processed barley that has been steeped in water, germinated on malting floors or in germination boxes or drums, and later dried in kilns for the purpose of stopping the germination and converting the insoluble starch in barley to the soluble substances and sugars in malt.</p>
                                    <p>Milling: The grinding of malt into grist (or meal) to facilitate the extraction of surgars and other soluble substances during the mash process.</p>

                                    <p>S</p>
                                    <p>Sediment: The refuse of solid matter that settles and accumulates at the bottom of fermenters, conditioning vessels and bottles of bottle-conditioned beer.</p>
                                    <p>Steeping: The soaking in liquid of a solid so as to extract flavors.</p>
                                    <p>T</p>
                                    <p>Tannins: A group of organic compounds contained in certain cereal grains and other plants. Tannins are present in the hop cone. </p>
                                    <p>Trub: Wort particles resulting from the precipitation of proteins, hop oils and tannins during the boiling and cooling stages of brewing.</p>
                                    <p>W</p>
                                    <p>Water: One of the four ingredients in beer. Some beers are made up by as much as 90% water.</p>
                                    <p>Wort: The bittersweet sugar solution obtained by mashing the malt and boiling in the hops, which becomes beer through fermentation.</p>
